  Hello! I'm Robert, and I am a graduate student at Stanford University. This website was created
  to serve as the hub connecting my various projects, research, blog posts, and interests. 
  I will prototype these skills on Github while learning HTML and CSS.

    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
    
    <h3>My Wallet</h3>
    <p> Last year, I saw my friend Ryan post about  “the extreme value proposition that exists in
      leveraging credit card sign-up bonuses to travel the world virtually for free.” After seeing
      this, I began to follow <a href="https://thepointsguy.com/"> The Points Guy</a> and others; 
      thanks to their expertise, I have amassed enough Points to travel to my hearts desire in 2018!
      Along the way, I gained a reputation among friends for being the “credit card guy”. As such, 
      I wanted to make a website to share exactly what cards are in my wallet, what bonuses I have
      earned, and what cards I recommend for fellow millennials! The site, Millennial Card Management,
      can be found HERE.
